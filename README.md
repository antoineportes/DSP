# DSP (Digital Signal Processing)

This is where I design filters, waveshapers and probably more.

You'll mostly find math and block diagrams here, maybe some notes about stuff I'm affraid to forget.

Those are not algorithms. Those are my babies. If you use them, I'd like to know and be credited.
Hence the MIT license.

At some point I will upload code using this material (probably [JSFX](https://www.cockos.com/EEL2/)).
I consider it examples of implementation and don't care so much for it.
So these examples will be licensed under the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License (WTFPL)](https://www.wtfpl.net).

I still consider myself a newbie and wanna help the likes of me as much as I can.

Let's make the categorical imperative more than some pedantic noise, shall we?
