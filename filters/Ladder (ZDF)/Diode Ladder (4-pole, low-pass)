//// How I built this diagram

  It's based upon two sources:
    1) Vadim Zavalishin "The Art of VA filter design" v. 2.1.2 p202
    2) Schematics of the Roland TB-303 VCF

  I've ignored the non-linearities in Vadim's block diagram, then added some modifications to have it better reflect the (ideal) analog model.
  First it's upside-down (input at the bottomn output at the top) because all schematics I've found display the ladder this way.
  Then I understood the reason to the halving gains (in the book): most Diode ladder VCFs have 4 capacitors in parallel.
  The 2nd, 3rd and 4th ones have equal capacitance and the first one has approximately half this capacitance.
  The cutoff frequency of a 1-pole RC circuit is wc (Hz) = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C), so doubling C is halving the cutoff.
  The cutoff gain can (mathematically) be extracted of the integrator. Which is what Vadim did by adding gains of 1 / 2 before integrators 2 to 4.
  By doing so he also decided that the reference-cutoff was the one of the first filter in the cascade.  This makes sense for high values of k,
  since this frequency is the closest to the resonance peak, but with k -> 0 the curve of the amplitude response looks shifted to the left.
  So no matter which reference you choose, the overall cutoff has to be rescaled according to k.
  Just for fun, I chose to go the other way around: use LP 2, 3 & 4 as reference and double the cutoff in LP 1.
