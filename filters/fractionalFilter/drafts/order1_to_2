          FRACTIONAL FILTER: ORDER 1 -> 2
################################################################

  This is the first (and only at the time of writing) continuous-slope filter that I've been able to
  implement. It's not fractional per se: it's always a 2-pole filter based upon the SVF filter, but
  extra gains in the block diagram make it crossfade between a 1-pole filter and a 2-pole filter in
  a way that reproduces the expected behaviour of a fractional-order filter.
  
  It goes from 6.02... dB/oct to 12.04... dB/oct. 
  It's of limited use on its own but I need to write it down so it can serve as a template to workaround
  the the fractional exponent for other orders — specifically 0 to 1, for I'm pretty sure that 0 to 1
  and 1 to 2 are the core elements of the intended system.
