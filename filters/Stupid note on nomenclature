//  Biquad filters

  Biquad is short for biquadratic. It refers to the fact that the transfer function's denominator is a quadratic formula
  which is another name for "second order polynomial".

  So really, biquad only means 2nd-order filter.
  It says nothing on the topology. It can use classical BLT, trapezoidal integration, DF1, DF2, TDF1, TDF2...
  It can even be analog.

  So please, whoever happens to read this, stop saying stuff like "biquad vs. ZDF" etc.
  Thanks.


//  Damping

  Biquad filters usually have an adjustable resonance.
  There are several variables commonly used to implement this resonance.

  The quality factor:
    Everyone seems to agree on calling it Q (for "Quality" I suppose...).
    Q is convenient because it's equal to the gain / magnitude / amplitude at the cutoff frequency, and because there seems
    to be a consensus regarding its name.

  Then there's this other variable  =  1 / 2 * Q.
    This one is convenient because it avoids writing a fraction in the denominator of a bigger fraction and because it's present
    on block diagrams.

    But what makes it really not convenient is that no one agrees on how to call it.
    Sometimes it's called R, sometimes it's half the parameter k, sometimes it's the Greek letter zeta...
    We don't even know if it's the Damping factor or the Damping ratio...

    Ratio makes sense because it's inversely proportional to the resonance. Factor makes sense because it's used as a factor in
    block diagrams and transfer functions.
    No way to choose here, but we can all agree on "Damping".

    I guess "R" is for "Ratio" (perhaps "Resonance"?) but I think it creates confusion with "R" as in "RC circuit" (i.e. Resistance)
    which is not quite unrelated to filters. (Also in stereo DSP, "R" often means "right channel".)
    k is a common name for a constant in an equation, but I believe that this is precisely a good reason to leave it available...
    Zeta is elegant. Until you start coding...

  Ok. Now that I've established that there are too many different terminologies, let me introduce some more confusion by stating:
    From now on, I'll call it "D" for "Damping". You may keep calling it as you please. (I like Suzan for instance.)
